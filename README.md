2. Studying basic **Algorithm**
3. and more

## 1. Practicing Canvas API

Public: [DEMO](https://daily-canvas-whasse.web.app/)

![demo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/benibana2001/daily-coding/images/canvas_demo_01.gif)

Daily or weekly, I write code to practice Web animation with Canvas API.

I have already written some animation, like:

- pixel animation (add TouchEvents)
  - I love pixer arts ðŸŽ¨
- dot animation
- reversi like game

This is just my practices, so that not using some Framework.

## 2. Studying basic Algorithm (with JavaScript)

For my study, I challenge some algorithm task on [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/).

I preserve those tasks(functions) on this repository to review and run test with Jest.
